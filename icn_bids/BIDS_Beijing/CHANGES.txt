	Fix JSON Format in all '_ieeg.json' files
	Replace 'ID NUMBER' with 'participants_id' in participants.tsv file
	Add 'Name' field in dataset_description.json
	Fix "Authors" JSON Format in dataset_description.json

04.10.2021 - Jonathan
nr 12, 14, 16, 21, 22
	added the coord and electrode.tsv file templates using https://github.com/neuromodulation/icn/blob/master/icn_bids/BIDS_Beijing/change_channel_names_v6.py

29.09.2021 - Jonathan
nr 12, 14, 16, 21, 22
	converted edf to brainvision using edf_to_brainvision_v3.py
	changed the subject naming with v21_relabeltool
	updated channel types 
	updated channel names with change_channel_names_v3.py
	tested the dataset with mne_bids read_raw_BIDS_test_dataset.py
	=> error for CapTrak https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids/issues/723#issuecomment-799307076
	changed session naming
nr 6, 8, 10 11 13, C001
	took from raw data set locally stored at Timon's PC
	updated channel types to dbs
	updated channel names to swap type number and side to type side and number
	changed session naming
	
	
For all together
	created phenotype folder and matched the clinical data of the subjects (subject 1-13 are missing some fields!)
	moved the old electrode visualizations to the derivatives
	created new participants.tsv
	created new dataset.description
	moved the coord and electrode.tsv files into new rawdata for subject 1+6-13
	changed channel naming for the electrode.tsv files
	created new template for electrode.tsv files for the 12-22
	standardized the imaging sessions -> but not the anat images itself
	changed naming to ButtonPressL (left index finger)
	added acq StimOff everywhere
	
	moved ECOG localization of Meera of source data to derivatives
	changed subject naming in the source data
	!!! removed the electrodes coord files made by Beijing team in the rawdata (kept only those in sourcedata)
	!!! merged the json files of sourcedata to rawdata where possible e.g. only FOGC001 had json for rest task

Extra subjects of Beijing
nr 12, 14, 16, 20, 21
	took backup in Backup channel
	unzipped in source data
	created new BIDS folders

20.09.2021 - Timon
 - subjects: 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, C001
 - adapted channel types
 - rewrite coordinates.tsv files
 - added clean TTL signal for button press task
 - code: icn_bids/general_BIDS_codes/write_Beijing_TTLclean_typesclean_coordclean.ipynb

Discussion with Tiantan:
  ECoG coordinates appear inverted to powerpoint
	Unit of the data
	Were instructions changed during task performance of sub-FOG011.
	DBS electrode localizations (we can perform them ourselves with Lead-DBS)
	UPDRS scores
